## Project Description
I have used line graphs, pie charts and bar charts to explore how age, education, job and marital status affected the subscription rate of the marketing campaign. 

From my analysis, customers aged between 30 and 60 had a low subscription rate of of around 12% while those aged above 85 mostly had a very high subscription rate of 80% and over. Those below 18 years of age had around 60% subscription rate. 

A higher percentage of customers with a tertiary education had subsribed compared to the ones who did not. 

In terms of job, students had the highest subscription rates followed by retired and unemployed people. Housemaids, entrepreneur and blue-collar workers had the lowest subscription rate. 

The campaign was not popular among married people as single and divorced customers had much higher subscription rate.
